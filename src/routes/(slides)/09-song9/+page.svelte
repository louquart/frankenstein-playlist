    <pre>
All day starin' at the ceilin' makin'
Friends with shadows on my wall
All night hearing voices tellin' me
That I should get some sleep
Because tomorrow might be good for somethin'
Hold on, feelin' like I'm headed for a breakdown
And I don't know why
But I'm not crazy, I'm just a little unwell
I know, right now you can't tell
But stay a while and maybe then you'll see
A different side of me
I'm not crazy, I'm just a little impaired
I know, right now you don't care
But soon enough you're gonna think of me
And how I used to be, me
I'm talkin' to myself in public, dodging glances on the train
And I know, I know they've all been talkin' about me
I can hear them whisper, and it makes me think
There must be somethin' wrong with me
Out of all the hours thinkin', somehow I've lost my mind
But I'm not crazy, I'm just a little unwell
I know, right now you can't tell
But stay a while and maybe then you'll see
A different side of me
I'm not crazy, I'm just a little impaired
I know, right now you don't care
But soon enough you're gonna think of me
And how I used to be
I've been talkin' in my sleep
Pretty soon they'll come to get me
Yeah, they're takin' me away
I'm not crazy, I'm just a little unwell
I know, right now you can't tell
But stay a while and maybe then you'll see
A different side of me
I'm not crazy, I'm just a little impaired
I know, right now you don't care
But soon enough you're gonna think of me
And how I used to be yeah, how I used to be
How I used to be
How I used to be
Well, I'm just a little unwell
How I used to be
How I used to be
I'm just a little unwell...

        Connection to_<i> Frankenstein</i>:
    </h1>

    <pre>
The theme of struggling with one's inner turmoil and not feeling fully understood is relevant 
to both Victor and the creature.

Throughout the story, Victor falls sick whenever something causes him to become exceptionally guilty, 
allowing him to temporarily escape his responsibility.
        
"The human frame could no longer support the agonies that I endured, and I was carried out of the room in 
strong convulsions. A fever succeeded to this. I lay for two months on the point of death," (Shelly 191)

        ðŸŽµ Lyrics ðŸŽµ
    </h1>
    <br />
    <pre>
A winter's day
In a deep and dark December
I am alone
Gazing from my window to the streets below
On a freshly fallen silent shroud of snow
I am a rock I am an island
I've built walls
A fortress deep and mighty
That none may penetrate
I have no need of friendship, friendship causes pains
It's laughter and it's loving I disdain
I am a rock I am an island
Don't talk of love
Well I've heard the word before
It's sleeping in my memory
I won't disturb the slumber of feelings that have died
If I never loved I never would have cried
I am a rock I am an island
I have my books
And my poetry to protect me
I am shielded in my armor
Hiding in my room safe within my womb
I touch no one and no one touches me
I am a rock I am an island
And a rock feels no pain
And an island never cries

        Connection to_<i> Frankenstein</i>:

The theme of isolation and self-imposed exile in this song echoes 
the loneliness experienced by both Victor and the creature.

Two appropriate parts of the story for this song would be both times when Victor shuts himself 
off from the rest of the world as he is creating on the creatures.

"In a solitary chamber, or rather cell, at the top of the house, and separated from all the other 
apartments by a gallery and staircase, I kept my workshop of filthy creation" (Shelly 55)

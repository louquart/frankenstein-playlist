        ðŸŽµ Lyrics ðŸŽµ
    </h1>
    <br />
    <pre>
How can you see into my eyes like open doors?
Leading you down into my core
Where I've become so numb
Without a soul
My spirit's sleeping somewhere cold
Until you find it there and lead it back home
Wake me up inside (save me)
Call my name and save me from the dark (wake me up)
Bid my blood to run (I can't wake up)
Before I come undone (save me)
Save me from the nothing I've become
Now that I know what I'm without
You can't just leave me
Breathe into me and make me real
Bring (bring) me (me) to life
Wake me up inside (save me)
Call my name and save me from the dark (wake me up)
Bid my blood to run (I can't wake up)
Before I come undone (save me)
Save me from the nothing I've become
Bring me to life
I've been living a lie
There's nothing inside
Bring me to life
Frozen (frozen) inside without your touch
Without your love, darling
Only (only) you are the life among the dead
All of this time, I can't believe I couldn't see
Kept in the dark, but you were there in front of me
I've been sleeping a thousand years, it seems
Got to open my eyes to everything
Without a thought, without a voice, without a soul
Don't let me die here
(There must be something more) bring me to life
Wake me up inside (save me)
Call my name and save me from the dark (wake me up)
Bid my blood to run (I can't wake up)
Before I come undone (save me)
Save me from the nothing I've become
Bring me to life
I've been living a lie
There's nothing inside
Bring me to life

        Connection to_<i> Frankenstein</i>:
    </h1>
    <br />
    <pre>
The song's theme of being brought to life and awakened echoes the moment when Victor 
Frankenstein animates the creature.

"It was already one in the morning; the rain pattered dismally against the panes, and my candle 
was nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of the half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye 
of the creature open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs." (Shelly 58)

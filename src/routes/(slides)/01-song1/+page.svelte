        ðŸŽµ Lyrics ðŸŽµ
    </h1>
    <br />
    <pre>
When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so very special
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't care if it hurts
I want to have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so very special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here, oh, oh
She's running out the door
She's running
She run, run, run, run
Run
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so very special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here

        Connection to_<i> Frankenstein</i>:
    </h1>

    <pre>
        The feelings of alienation and not belonging expressed in the song 
        resonate with the creature's experiences of rejection by society in the novel.

        This song would be most fitting when the creature kills himself at the end of the story.
